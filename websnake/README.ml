# ReasonReact Snake!

Made with [ReasonReact](https://github.com/reasonml/reason-react), whose docs are [here](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/).

```
git clone https://github.com/rdavison/llama-snake
cd llama-snake/websnake
npm install
npm start
# in another tab
npm run build
```

After you see the webpack compilation succeed (the `npm run build` step), open up the nested html files in `src/*` (**no server needed!**). Then modify whichever file in `src` and refresh the page to see the changes.
